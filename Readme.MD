#### Airflow Temperature Forecast
This pipeline is an Airflow application designed to collect, transform, and predict city temperature data via an API. Its architecture is based on a Docker image of Airflow, integrated with Scikit-learn, and follows the DAG outlined below.
The process begins by retrieving real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap for a wide selection of cities worldwide. In this solution, we use GET requests to collect temperature data for Paris, London, and Washington, storing it in a Docker container in JSON format.
The next step is to extract these JSON files and consolidate them into a single CSV file, transforming them into a dataset for training and testing. For the modeling stage, we illustrate the predictive capabilities of both linear and non-linear models without using hyperparameter tuning. Based on the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE), the pipeline selects the best-performing model, generates the desired predictions, and exports the most effective model.
